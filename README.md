# Otherbot2
Otherbot2drivebase
This code is for the drive base. Hopefully once the intake code gets finished we will use an inline parrellel command group to run them at the same. We use LY for the
vertical, and RX for the horizontal input. We use vector calculations for speed and rotation, and input into an arcade drive. In teh next iteration of the code, to quit 
the code we will use the B button.
